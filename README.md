# Fibonacci-generator
This project was made to generate the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) for an indefinite amount of terms and allow users to see what the nth term in the sequence is. Project is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and was made to try to challenge myself as suggested at the end of [Chapter 3.5](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html) in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). If you find this script helpful or interesting please star it or share it to others that may find it helpful as well. 

You can use it by compiling it using [rustc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/) or the wrapper, [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/).
